-   2  teaspoons  [Vanilla](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Watkins-All-Natural-Original-Gourmet-Baking-Vanilla-Extract-2-fl-oz/479192660)
-   2 3/4  cup [Flour](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Self-Rising-Flour-5-lb/10402992)
-   1 1/2  teaspoon  [Cream of Tartar](https://www.walmart.com/ip/McCormick-Gourmet-All-Natural-Cream-Of-Tartar-2-62-oz/10535060)
-   1/2 teaspoon  [Baking Soda](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Baking-Soda-4-oz-ZIN-524708/762839254)
-   1  teaspoon  Salt

**Cinnamon-Sugar Mixture:**

-   1/4  cup  Sugar
-   1 1/2  Tablespoons  [Cinnamon](https://www.walmart.com/ip/McCormick-Ground-Cinnamon-7-12-oz/550652866)

## **Instructions:**

1.  Preheat [oven](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Magic-Chef-24-Electric-Wall-Oven-with-Convection/881641790) to 350 degrees.
    
2.  In a large [mixing bowl](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Crestware-1-1-2-qt-Stainless-Steel-Mixing-Bowl-Silver-Stainless-Steel-MB01/460524583), cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the [eggs](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Marketside-Organic-Cage-Free-Brown-Eggs-Large-12-count-24-oz/48319448) and vanilla. Cream for 1-2 minutes longer.
    
3.  Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and [salt](https://www.walmart.com/ip/2-pack-Great-Value-Iodized-Salt-26-oz/373932397), just until combined.
    
4.  In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon.
    
5.  If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. Roll into small balls until round and smooth. Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a [spoon](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Walco-1107-Length-7-In-Dessert-Spoon-Pack-of-24/361323514), coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered. *To make flatter snicker-doodles, press down in the center of the ball before placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle.* 
    
6.  Place on a [parchment paper-lined baking sheet](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Reynolds-Parchment-Paper-Baking-Sheets-22-Count-12x16in/36531884). Bake for 9-11 minutes. Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the [pan](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mainstays-Medium-Cookie-Pan/14913186).
